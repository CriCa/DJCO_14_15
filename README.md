Writhe is a 3D survival-horror multiplayer game. Designed for up to 4 players, it aims to offer an unique online experience for both horror fans and beginners looking for the next multiplayer challenge. In Writhe, a group of four people wake up inside an unknown room. They must work together in order to escape from a series of challenges in what appears to be an endless maze. The players themselves get to decide who to work with, or against, as they attempt to carve a path to the end.

A group of four people wake up inside an unknown room. But how many leave?
